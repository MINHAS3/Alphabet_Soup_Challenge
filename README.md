# Alphabet_Soup_Challenge

The Alphabet Soup Cahllenge, is an analysis of the companies that Alphabet has invested that they feel will provide good return on it's invest. 

How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?
I slected various amount of neural networks were 3 layers respectfully to neural network. 
I chose these various amounts because I was hoping to achieve the minimum results of 75% however, 
that didn't occur with any of the layers. The numbers came close but didn't achieve the result I was 
hoping for. 

Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
I was not able to achieve the target model performance. The steps I took were increasing each layer by 100 at least 3
different times I wasn't able the target goal needed in the challenge. 

If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?
I would use the Deep learning model, this model I feel will allow for the required outcome to be needed. Deep learning model will 
find the results needed, it narrow the down the list to specific ones to meet the end results.
