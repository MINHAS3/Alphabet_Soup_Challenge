# Alphabet_Soup_Challenge

The Alphabet Soup Cahllenge, is an analysis of the companies that Alphabet has invested that they feel will provide good return on it's invest. 

How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?
I slected high amount in the layer to have more output per layer
I chose multiple layers because I was hoping to achieve the minimum results of 75% however, 
that didn't occur with any of the layers. The numbers came close but didn't achieve the result I was 
hoping for. 

Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
I was not able to achieve the target model performance. I manupuilated the layers to get close as I could with the projected output.

If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?
I would use the Deep learning model, this model I feel will allow for the required outcome to be needed. Deep learning model will 
find the results needed randomly. It won't matach the target 100% of the of time. It is a prediction model not to be accurate.
